# CSVS ENSO Server

## Introduction

This application provides an user interface through a REST API to serve Multivariate ENSO Index Version 2 (MEI.v2) data 
in CSV format.

The values are provided from https://www.psl.noaa.gov/enso/mei/

It provides two simple entry points:

### Update ENSO values

future.
